# Ryze UniswapX Filler — Architecture & Implementation Plan

> **Status:** M0–M3 implemented and the **mainnet-fork fill gate is PASSED** (2026-07-07, RUNBOOK §4b): a real
> fill executed end-to-end on a Base fork — real reactor/router/oracle/pool, live signed payloads, exact MPS
> settlement. OQ-1/OQ-2/OQ-4 resolved. Remaining before M4 is owner ops only: deploy the executor, whitelist it
> on the router (`pauseDirectSwap` is ON), shadow-run, sign-off. Deploy/go-live: `RUNBOOK.md`; next steps:
> `FOLLOWUP.md`. See §7.
> **Owner:** Amit. This doc is the handoff spec — any agent picking up a milestone should read this file, then `/CLAUDE.md` (system guide), then the referenced source files.

## 1. Goal

Run a filler that wins **UniswapX Priority Orders on Base** by sourcing liquidity from **Ryze SmartShield pools**, routing external orderflow into Ryze (volume, fees, WBR) while earning filler margin. Secondary goal: the on-chain executor + quoting layer double as the public reference integration for third-party solvers ("how to route through Ryze").

Non-goals (for now): Dutch orders on mainnet/Arbitrum, CoW solver engine (separate project, reuses the payload + quoting layers built here), cross-chain fills.

---

## 2. External protocol facts (verified 2026-07-05)

- **Reactor:** `PriorityOrderReactor` on Base at **`0x000000001Ec5656dcdB24D90DFa42742738De729`**. Same interface as all UniswapX reactors: `execute`, `executeBatch`, `executeWithCallback`, `executeBatchWithCallback`.
- **Auction = priority gas auction.** No Dutch decay. Each order carries a baseline (min) output. For **every wei of tx priority fee above the order's `baselinePriorityFeeWei` threshold, the swapper is owed +1 MPS** (milli-basis-point, 1/1000 bp = 1e-7) more output (exact-input orders) or less input. Highest-priority-fee fill wins; all competing txs **revert on-chain** (reactor reverts early to cheapen losses, but losers still pay gas).
- **Start block:** each order is executable only after its `auctionTargetBlock` (a few blocks after publication). Uniswap Labs may **cosign** to advance the start block — parse as `CosignedPriorityOrder`.
- **Order discovery:** poll `GET https://api.uniswap.org/v2/orders?orderStatus=open&orderType=Priority&chainId=8453`, or register a **webhook** with Uniswap Labs (lower latency; do this once the bot is stable). Parse with `@uniswap/uniswapx-sdk` **≥ 2.1.0-beta.13** (`CosignedPriorityOrder.parse(serialized, chainId)`).
- **Callback fill flow (`executeWithCallback`):**
  1. Reactor pulls the swapper's input tokens via Permit2 and transfers them to the executor contract.
  2. Reactor calls `reactorCallback(ResolvedOrder[] orders, bytes callbackData)` on the executor.
  3. Executor must end the callback holding the resolved output amounts **approved to the reactor**.
  4. Reactor transfers outputs to the order recipients. Everything atomic — any shortfall reverts.
- Filling is **permissionless**: no KYC, no bond, no whitelist on the UniswapX side.

## 3. Ryze-side facts (verified against this repo)

- Swaps go through `src/amm/MultiHopRouter.sol` → `swapExactIn(SwapParams)` / `swapExactOut`. **Permissionless** unless `pauseDirectSwap` is set, in which case caller must be in `isWhitelistedIntentSwapper` (owner-settable — whitelist the executor regardless, so a future pause doesn't kill the filler).
- Router `safeTransferFrom(msg.sender)`s the input → executor must **approve the router** for input tokens.
- **Caller-supplied prices:** every swap must include fresh `pythUpdateData` (Pyth Lazer payloads) + `cexPriceData` (signed CEX prices); router runs `_updateAndVerifyPrices` in the same tx. Stale/absent payloads ⇒ revert. This is the core integration burden — see §5.3.
- **Exact off-chain quotes:** `src/amm/WeightedPoolQueries.sol#querySwapExactIn` returns the full SmartShield quote **including sessionized fees for `msg.sender`'s session** — quote with the executor address as caller (`eth_call` with `from` override) so previews match execution.
- **Sessionization applies to the executor.** TSP session key = (trader, pool); trader = router's `msg.sender` = the executor. Repeated same-direction fills through one pool accumulate sessionized slippage/WBF. Netting (opposite-direction flow), EMA decay, and `tMax`/`bMax` resets bound it. **Decision: do NOT exempt the executor** — rely on netting/decay, and let the bot's quoter price it in (it does automatically, since `querySwapExactIn` is session-aware).
- **WBF/WBR asymmetry:** improving-direction fills get fee suppression + possible WBR (paid in output token from treasury) ⇒ bot should bid more aggressively on improving flow. `amountOut + wbrFee >= minAmountOut` is the router-side check.

Fill tx lifecycle: bot sees order → quotes Ryze net-out → if `ryzeOut > orderOutAt(bid) + gas + margin`, submits `executor.execute(order, fillData)` with chosen `maxPriorityFeePerGas` → reactor pulls swapper input to executor → callback swaps through Ryze (fresh price payloads embedded in `fillData`) → outputs approved back to reactor → reactor pays swapper. Win = spread kept by executor; lose = revert (gas cost only).

## 5. Components

### 5.1 On-chain: `RyzeUniswapXExecutor.sol`

**Location:** `src/RyzeUniswapXExecutor.sol` in this standalone repo (Foundry, solc 0.8.30 / via-ir; `forge-std` + `openzeppelin-contracts` submodules). Tests in `test/`. Decoupled from the Ryze source tree via the minimal `IRyzeRouter` interface (field-compatible with the deployed `MultiHopRouter`), so the project builds without ryze-contracts checked out.

Responsibilities:
- `execute(SignedOrder calldata order, bytes calldata fillData)` — `onlyOperator` entrypoint → `reactor.executeWithCallback(order, fillData)`.
- `reactorCallback(ResolvedOrder[] calldata, bytes calldata fillData)` — `onlyReactor`. Decode `fillData` = `(Hop[] path, uint256 minAmountOut, uint256 deadline, bytes[] pythUpdateData, IOracle.CexPriceData[] cexPriceData)`; approve router for input; call `MultiHopRouter.swapExactIn` (recipient = executor); make resolved outputs available to reactor. **ERC20 outputs:** approve the reactor — its `_fill` pulls each via `transferFrom(executor, recipient)` (source-verified). **Native-ETH outputs:** the sentinel is `address(0)` (NOT `0xeeee…`); the reactor pays the recipient from its **own** balance via `.call`, so the executor must **send ETH to the reactor** during the callback — unwrap the WETH the swap delivered (`weth.withdraw`) and forward it. Leftover output above what the order owes is the filler's spread.
- Admin (Owned): `setOperator`, `sweep` (tokens + ETH, to owner), `approveRouter(token)`, `receive()`.
- Keep it dumb: **no pricing logic on-chain.** All economics decided off-chain; the router's `minAmountOut` + reactor's output check are the safety rails.

Vendored interfaces (`src/interfaces/`): `IReactor`, `IReactorCallback`, `ReactorStructs` (`ResolvedOrder`/`SignedOrder`/…), `IWETH`, and `IRyzeRouter`.

### 5.2 Off-chain bot (`uniswapx-filler/bot/`, TypeScript)

Modules (keep them separate files/services — the quoter and payload-service get reused by the future CoW engine):

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `order-ingestor` | Poll orders API every ~1s (webhook later). Filter: chainId 8453, tokens with a Ryze pool path, size within band limits. Track order lifecycle to avoid duplicate bids. |
| `payload-service` | Maintain hot cache of latest Pyth Lazer payloads + signed CEX prices for all Ryze pool assets (same feed pipeline production uses — **reference client: `limit-order-bot/` (Go, in this repo): `internal/oracle/cex_oracle.go` (signed-CEX WS), `internal/oracle/pyth_price.go` (Pyth Lazer WS), `internal/executor/executor_amm.go` (fill assembly); also `../ryze-router`**). Expose `getPayloads(assets[]) → {pythUpdateData, cexPriceData, prices: TokenPrice[]}` with freshness timestamps. |
| `quoter` | Best Ryze path (single/multi-hop over configured pools) via `querySwapExactIn` `eth_call` with `from = executor`. Returns net out incl. sessionized fees + WBR. |
| `strategy` | Profit: `profit(bid) = ryzeNetOut − orderOutput(bid) − gasCost(bid)` where `orderOutput(bid) = baselineOut × (1 + mps(bid)/1e7)`, `mps(bid) = max(0, bid − baselinePriorityFeeWei)`. Pick bid targeting configured margin (start: capture ~50–80% of observed spread; tune from win/loss data). Shade up on improving-direction fills (WBR/fee suppression), down on worsening (WBF). Enforce caps: max notional/fill, max open exposure/token, max reverted-gas spend/hour, payload max-age. |
| `submitter` | Build `executor.execute` tx with `maxPriorityFeePerGas = bid`, fresh payloads fetched at send time, `deadline` = now + small buffer. Target `auctionTargetBlock` (cosigned earlier start if present). Track win/revert outcomes + P&L per fill. |
| `metrics` | Prometheus-style counters: orders seen/quoted/bid/won/reverted, spread captured, gas burned on losses, payload staleness, session state per pool. |

### 5.3 Price payload pipeline (critical path)

The whole filler lives or dies on payload freshness: the quote is only executable while the Pyth Lazer payload and CEX signatures the tx carries pass `PythProOracle` verification (tolerance/staleness checks — see `src/oracle/PythProOracle.sol`). Rules:
- Fetch payloads **immediately before send**, not at quote time; re-quote if price moved > threshold.
- The signed-CEX feed is split across two hosts (USDC vs ETH/BTC) — subscribe to both (**OQ-1, resolved**; see §8).
  Every fetch must cover ALL configured pool assets, not just the fill pair: the oracle requires a signed CEX
  price for every fresh feed in the Lazer blob (`allPoolAssets` in `bot/src/config.ts`).
- Store per-asset feed IDs/config in one place: `bot/config/base.json` (pools, assets, feed IDs, reactor + router + executor addresses, band limits).

---

## 6. Economics & risk

- **Losing bids revert but cost gas.** Base gas is cheap but nonzero; the early-revert in the reactor caps it. Budget reverted gas as customer acquisition; alert if losses/hour exceed cap.
- **No inventory risk in steady state** — input arrives from the reactor and is swapped atomically within the fill tx. Residual risks: payload staleness reverts, band-edge quotes (`externalLiquidityRatio` shifts with notional), session drift between quote and fill (another of our own fills landing first — serialize fills per pool).
- **Session accumulation** is the main quiet cost: monitor `N_net` per (executor, pool); prefer balanced two-way flow; back off when sessionized fees erode margin (quoter handles this automatically, strategy should log it explicitly).
- **MEV:** priority auctions are winner-take-all by fee, no sandwich vector on our fill (atomic, minAmountOut-guarded).

## 7. Milestones (agent handoff units)

| # | Deliverable | Definition of done |
|---|---|---|
| **M0** | Scaffolding | `src/filler/` + `test/filler/` + `uniswapx-filler/bot/` skeleton compile/lint in CI; UniswapX interfaces vendored; addresses/config file committed. |
| **M1** | `RyzeUniswapXExecutor` + fork tests | Foundry **Base fork test**: construct a signed PriorityOrder (Permit2 + order EIP-712 via `vm.sign`), execute against real reactor address with a mocked/forked Ryze pool + oracle payload stub; asserts swapper receives resolved output, executor keeps spread, native-output path covered. |
| **M2** | Quoter + payload-service | Bot quotes live Base orders (dry-run), logs would-be P&L incl. sessionized fees; payload cache hit-rate + staleness metrics. |
| **M3** | Strategy + submitter, **shadow mode** | Full loop running, computing bids, NOT sending txs; 1 week of shadow P&L logs reviewed. |
| **M4** | Live, capped | Whitelist/approve executor on router (owner op), caps at small notional; first won fill on Base verified end-to-end; runbook written. |
| **M5** | Hardening | Webhook feed, alerting, per-pool serialization, bid tuning from win/loss data; publish third-party "route through Ryze" integration doc extracted from this code. |

Rule for agents: milestones are sequential; do not start M4 without explicit owner sign-off (it moves real funds and requires the owner key for whitelisting).

## 8. Open questions (resolve before M2/M4)

- **OQ-1 (wire format resolved):** Signed CEX prices come from `us1.mainnet.pricing.ryze.pro`; Pyth Lazer via the
  Pro websocket stream (token held out-of-band). Endpoints wired (`bot/src/env.ts` + `payloads/source.ts`) and the
  wire format is reconciled against the `limit-order-bot` Go reference — subscribe frames, signed-CEX message
  shape, single shared-blob `pythUpdateData`. The router's Pyth verification fee is billed **per non-empty
  update blob** (`verification_fee() × n`, n = non-empty `pythUpdateData` elements; see
  `PythProOracle._updatePriceFeedsArray`), and we send one bundled blob so `n = 1`. **Coverage is resolved:** the
  signed-CEX feed is split across two hosts (USDC on `us1.mainnet.pricing.ryze.pro`, ETH+BTC on
  `us-signed-price-4tyzr.ondigitalocean.app`); subscribe to BOTH (comma-separated `RYZE_PRICING_URL`).
- **OQ-2 (resolved 2026-07-07):** `pauseDirectSwap` **is enabled** on Base (fork-verified) ⇒ executor
  whitelisting (`setWhitelistedIntentSwapper`, authority = Ryze pool owner `0x0A2C…`) is a **hard M4
  dependency** — no fill can execute without it. The `bot/src/forkFill.ts` mainnet-fork harness proved the full
  fill end-to-end (real reactor/router/oracle/pool, live payloads, exact MPS settlement; RUNBOOK §4b).
- **OQ-3 (non-blocking):** `intentFee` lane vs direct swap — direct `swapExactIn` avoids the intent fee, and the
  fork fill executed via direct swap with the executor whitelisted. Confirm with the Ryze team there is no plan to
  force fillers onto the intent lane (which would add the intent fee to our cost).
- **OQ-4 (resolved):** Ryze is live on Base — first pairs are **WETH-USDC** and **WBTC-USDC** (addresses in `bot/config/base.json`). Confirm typical order flow/sizes against these during M3 shadow.
- **OQ-5 (largely resolved by mainnet data, 2026-07-07):** last-30d addressable fills (ETH/WETH/USDC/cbBTC pairs):
  ~10/day, median $2.0k, p75 $5.0k, p90 $10.4k, ≈$1.7M/month — comfortably inside the 25k band cap and the
  10k per-fill cap. Live Ryze all-in cost at those sizes: 5–12.5 bps off CEX mid. Auction competition is real:
  median winner paid the swapper ~257 bps above baseline; ~10% of fills settle uncontested at baseline.
  Confirm with shadow data before raising caps.
